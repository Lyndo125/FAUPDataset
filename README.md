# FAUPDataset

This is the dataset used in paper "Semantic Segmentation of Weakly Annotated Remote Sensing Images Based on Feature Adversary and Uncertainty Perception"

## Details and sources

In this paper, we use four datasets to train and test our model. 

1. Residential area dataset  
This dataset is an extension of the dataset constructed by Ma et al. [1], which is captured from GeoEye-1. During the experimental process, we adopted a multi-band fusion method to combine images from bands 3, 2, and 1 to obtain richer and more accurate semantic information. The number of positive samples is 248, and the number of negative samples is 280.

2. Residential area dataset  
The dataset consists of residential area images captured from Google Earth. The number of positive samples is 300, and the number of negative samples is 280.

3. Lake dataset  
The dataset is selected from AID [2] and NWPU-RESISC45 [3]. Among them, there are 1120 positive samples, which are lake data, and 1130 negative samples, selected from data of categories such as forests and shadows.

4. Island dataset  
The dataset is selected from NWPU-RESISC45 and LEVIR [4]. Among them, there are 700 positive samples, which are lake data, and 613 negative samples, selected from data of sea.

Up to now, the lake and island dataset are available. We will continue to organize the remaining portions and upload them gradually.
